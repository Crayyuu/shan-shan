                <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 40px;">So hello, it's been a long time since I wrote you a letter. I enjoyed making those, it helped me convey my thoughts and unsaid feelings. This year has been interesting, and you have made my life so much easier and it doesn't feel like it's dry anymore. It's lively, you make my life brighter, often without realizing it. The small things you do, when you try to understand me, and your endless support mean the world to me. You're the first person who made me cry so fast, and what's amazing about it is everything you do, you do it effortlessly. I couldn't ask for more. You don't have any idea how happy and grateful I am that we're still together, despite the struggles that we encountered, you still manage to make me smile and maintain our communication healthy. Thank you for always being there, for never getting tired of saying goodnight even when i always forget about it (hehe). Please don't forget to take care of yourself, eat healthy and be careful. I worry about you so much. Thank you for being everything to me. I don't have any idea who I am going to be without you. You've helped me become the best version of myself. IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME WHEN YOU PRIORITIZE ME OVER OTHER THINGS HUHU, even when life gets busy you can still find a way to spend some time with me. I hope you smash all your dreams because you deserve nothing less. You're such a wonderful person, and with you, I can truly be myself. With you, I can open up without being scared, without a doubt of getting judged. I've never been good at telling people how I feel but you made me try. I was afraid of everything, insecurities are my biggest fear. But then you came along, and everything changed. I feel free to share what's in my heart. When i'm with you it feels so peaceful, and quiet it's like everything stopped and it's just us being happy together without minding each other's business. Sometimes we fail, but it doesn't mean we lose. Life may have its ups and downs, but what truly matters is the effort we put in. Mistakes are part of the journey, and I believe we’ll learn and grow from it. Just know you’re mine forever, and I have no intention of letting you go. I already imagined my life in the future with you so hehe. They said "Love is not about finding someone; it's about finding someone you can't live without." it's not always easy, but we will overcome it, no matter how tough it gets. Never change that personality of yours, I love it the most. Trust in God and stay true to yourself, and I know you will achieve great things, Shanika. HAPPY BIRTHDAY ULITTTT!!!!</p>
